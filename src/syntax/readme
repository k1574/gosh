# Syntax

Description of gosh syntax.

## Basic

Every script consists of list of commands as most of the
shelll, like:

	% cd dir1
	% cat file1 file2

## Variables

	% set var val # Set new "var" inside variable with "val" value. Not env. var.
	% unset var # Unset the "var" inside variable.
	% export VAR VAL  # Export new env. variable VAR with VAL value
	% import var ENVAR # Import environment variable to inside variable.
	% unexport VAR # Unexport var so it is empty.
	% echo $var # Will cause an error, var must be set or imported.

## Condition

If operator syntax:

	% if test -f file && {echo Block for example} {
		echo The file exists
	} else {
		echo The file does not exist
	}

Not:

	% if test -f file
	{
		echo The file exists
	}
	else
	{
		echo The file does not exist
	}

The reasons are lexer limitations.

# Alternative binary syntax

The idea is to make the simplest and the shortest
shell with just binary operators which will
simplify parser and so on.

	% test -f file &| {
		echo file exists!
	} || test -f file1 &| {
		echo file1 exists!
	} || {
		echo none of files exist
	}
